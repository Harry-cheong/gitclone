`gitclone` is a command line interface to make it easy to clone repository with a generated Github token. A personal preferrence honestly. Github Credential Manager also works.

Designed to work on Linux, MacOS or Windows as long as git is accessible on the terminal

At its core, `gitclone` automates `git clone https://[TOKEN]@github.com/[REPO-OWNER]/[REPO-NAME]`
